# MakersBnB

This was a mid week group task assigned during week 6 at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) - building an AirBnB clone from scratch using Node.js.

To see the full task spec, see `docs/task.md`

## Approach

Choosing our own tech stack, we decided on Bookshelf/Knex as our ORM. Having used ORM's (Datamapper) in Ruby only previously, which was relatively simple to use - initialising Bookshelf proved to be a challenge.

## Stack

* Node.js
* PostgreSQL
* Bookshelf/Knex, ORM
* Mocha/Chai and Zombie, testing
* ESLint, code quality

## How To Run

* Clone or download this repo to your local machine
* Navigate to the project folder in your terminal
* Run `bash install` to install all dependencies
* Run `bash migrate` to create the local SQL database
* Run `bash start` at the root to run the server
* Visit the listening port url `http://localhost:3000/`
* Run `bash test` at the root to run all tests
